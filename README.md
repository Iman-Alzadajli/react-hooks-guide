# React Hooks Guide ðŸ§ 

This project is a simple educational React app created with Vite to demonstrate the usage of various React Hooks.

## What we built so far

### UseStateDemo

The `UseStateDemo` component demonstrates the usage of the `useState` Hook:

- Initializes a state variable `message` with the default value `"Hello"`.
- Displays the current `message`.
- Includes an input box where users can type text.
- When the input changes, it updates the `message` state using `setMessage`.
- React automatically re-renders the component when the state changes, reflecting the updated text instantly.

This example helps beginners understand how to manage state and handle user input in React functional components.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
2. Run the development server:
3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Next steps

- Adding more hooks demos like `useEffect`, `useRef`, etc.
- Implementing simple exercises to practice each hook.
